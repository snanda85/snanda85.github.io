Hi. I'm Sandeep Nanda

I am a programmer by profession, and have a fair share of python experience.
I do a little bit of everything, but I'm happiest working with Python (with/without Django)

I like to eat exotic stuff, although there are very less chances of getting it.

I'm a fan of Game of Thrones, and hope that Tyrion Lannister gets to sit on the Iron throne
