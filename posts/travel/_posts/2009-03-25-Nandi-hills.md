2009, March 20th:  
It was around 7pm friday when Samy and I were riding back home from office, while discussing our plans for the long weekend of the coming week.  

I was a bit frustrated, 'coz my Saturday was meant to be a working day this week. So I was uttering the same old words again and again..'life sucks'.. :)  
Suddenly, out of nowhere came the words, 'lets go to Nandi hills today'. Samy didn't have to think before saying yes [it's his weekend anyways :)].

We asked a few people for the biking trip, and got 1 positive reply. So, we had 2 bikes and 3 guys to move on. Me, Samy and Ashish.

So the plan was to leave at 3am. and we got ready by time.  
The route to be taken was BTM --> MG Road --> Rajbhawan Rd --> Devanahalli --> Nandi hills

<!--more-->

We left with full-on excitement. But on reaching 'The Forum mall', our minds went on a different track and thought for a minute to go to Iskon temple instead. It didn't take another minute to drop the idea :).

Everything went smooth till Rajbhawan road, where we took a wrong turn and lost our way. But it didn't take time to realise the mistake and to return back for the right direction.

Finally, we landed on the highway towards BIAL Airport. A perfectly smooth road to drive on, but a little bit frustrating experience for me. I was driving at 80km/hr but I had to stick to the 60kmph lane. 'coz 80km lane was occupied by cabs driving at 120kmph.[Max. speed limit on this road is 80km/hr :)]. Not to mention, Ashish was also testing his Pulsar's speed limits here :).

We crossed the airport flyover in around 25 more mins, and now we had to go till Devanahalli and take a left turn toward Nandi hills.

*Beware of the speed breakers on this highway to Devanahalli.

Samy bounced for 1.5 ft on one of them :).

As soon as we took the turn from Devanahalli, there came a complete change in the atmosphere. A cool breeze told us that this effort is not going to waste. This 23 km stretch from Devanahalli to Nandi hills was just delicious.

We left the highway lights behind us, and now were on our head-lamps only.

Bound by my habit, I kept on turning off my head lights after every few mins, with Samy continuously abusing me:), and Ashish wondering if I am drunk :)

The last 6 km curvy drive just gave me what I've been longing for. A delicate ride in the lap of mother nature..

Finally, we reached the top at 5 am, and found that the ticket counter was to be opened at 6am. So we had an hour left at our dispense for bird-gazing[:)]. We had a few sips of cool drinks and waited for the tickets.


Got the tickets and started moving for the peak. Not very eventful climb except that Samy was clicking his Cam at each and every point. We reached the peak and saw the beautiful morning sun rising from just below eye-level.

Now the drinks started showing their colors. On our way back, there was not even a single wall or bush left where we've not PEEed ;). Average time between two consecutive trips was not more than 3.5 mins :).

We had a cuppa' tea and nariyal-pani at the top and started the journey back after staying for an hour or two. Samy was overflowing with excitement and came back jumping all over around [Did I mention that he had a fracture in his knee? :)]

We came down without wasting much time as I had to leave for office. But I had to keep on pushing Samy and Ashish.

We kicked off our bikes at 8.30am, and were there at Devanahalli at 9:15. As soon as we landed on the Airport highway, the deafening traffic realized me that I am still in bangalore.

With noise and pollution all around, It took me another one and a half hour to reach Electronics city.

With an image of the rising sun in mind I laid back on my seat to resume office work.

...and lived happily ever after !!! :)
