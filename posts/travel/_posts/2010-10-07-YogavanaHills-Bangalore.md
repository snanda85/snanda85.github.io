    Yes, we drove through this..

Very rarely a time comes when we make friends out of nowhere. Something similar happened with me when I was having ginger tea ;), at the famous ginger tea adda in BTM.

I saw two guys carrying the newly launched magazine of xbhp. Since I didn't get to buy that mag yet, so i tried to a have a peep in their copy. This was how I got to meet John, Avin and Deejay.

Till that time, I used to visit biking forums like xbhp just to read stuff, but never got to ride with any of the groups. So, I was actually awed to know that these guys actually are the admins of a forum bangalorebikers.com [though I hid my expressions at that time :) ] 

I asked them if they are having any ride in near future that I can join, and luckily they were going for a short ride the same sunday.

I came home and registered on the forum to know the developments.

###The Ride-day (03-Oct-2010)

The plan was to meet John at 5.45 am. But as I was about to leave, it started drizzling. So, I sent a text to John to ask if there is any delay in the plan. But everything was on time, and we got to meet at Shopper's Stop. We were 5 people to meet at Shopper's Stop, and others joined us at kanakpura road metro store.

John clicked some nice pics at the starting point [and he kept on doing that good work all the way]

I think it was 6.30am when we started from Metro towards our destination.

Till this time I didn't know where exactly were we going :).

This was my first ride in a group of more than 2 bikes, and I was feeling the difference already. Each one of us was following the formation, and those hand signals were cool :). I must confess that my concentration was on the group and not on the surroundings till this time.

In about half an hour, I noticed the glowing left indicators of all the bikes in front. I wondered what happened, turned on my indicators too, and everyone came to a halt. This was Harohalli village, and in front of us was a small shop, with the name 'Idli Mane(ಇಡ್ಲಿ ಮನೆ)'- translating to 'Idli house'. I wondered what's special about this place, but the Thatte idli (ತಟ್ಟೆ ಇಡ್ಲಿ) here was actually 'mastt' :) [For that matter, I think I am gonna go there again just to have that Idly once more]

In another half an hour, we were back on track for Yogavana Hills. John told that we'll have 3kms of off-roading, and we were all like "what's the big deal?".

So, we started towards the peak, having quite a bumpy ride there. After the plains, there was a bit of off-road climb for the peak. We were about to reach the top when my bike [because of lower ground clearance] landed on a rock, and stuck there. So i decided to keep it there and move forward for the rest 50mts or so. Reaching the top all happy, we at once started a photo session. Some poses were more than just funny. :)

Tariq, Pavan and I decided to trek for the peak. The trek through the thorns resulted in an awesome view of bangalore at the top, with the cool breeze of air vaporising all the sweat on our foreheads. Bangalore looked so green from the top. Had the other guys not called us, we had no intention to come down for another 1 hr or so :)

</div>

We came down and the return journey was about to start, when I noticed the leaking petrol from my motorcycle. I thought this was bound to happen, because the stone had hit real bad. I was worried about it the whole way, but only after reaching home did I find the actual reason for the leakage. The petrol was up to the brim, and when I parked the bike, it was tilted more than the usual angle, due to the soft earth there. The petrol actually leaked from the lid itself. Funny !!! :D

On our way back, we stopped at the NICE road junction, clicked a few pics, bade good bye to each other hoping to join in for another ride, and left towards our places. At around 11.30, I had the motorcycle parked in front of my house.

With reflection of the green bangalore in mind and the taste of thatte idly still on my lips, I crashed back on my bed..

...and lived happily ever after!! :)
