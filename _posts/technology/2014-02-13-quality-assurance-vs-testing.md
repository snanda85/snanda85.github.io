While both the terms are used interchangeably in most of the organizations, QA and Testing are two very different activities with somewhat similar target i.e. to deliver a product with finesse.

**Testing** is a set of tasks performed to make sure that the product is delivered with minimal (if at all) defects.

**QA (Quality Assurance)** is a set of tasks & responsibilities that are performed in order to deliver a high quality product.

Notice the subtle difference between the two definitions. By this definition, QA becomes a superset of Testing. *Quality Assurance* is the **responsibility** to ensure that the delivered product satisfies the quality criteria, including but not limited to bug-free code, customer satisfaction, requirement validation & verification.

While *Testing* includes activities of finding defects in an already developed software, QA comprises of activities like Design Reviews, Code Reviews, Requirement Validation, Efficient Coding, Testing etc. These activities simply cannot be done once a product is already developed.

In my opinion, An organization can certainly have a separate Testing team, but Quality Assurance is not the task of any one individual or a team. It has to be taken care of at all levels of product delivery, right from Management to Development to Deployment.
