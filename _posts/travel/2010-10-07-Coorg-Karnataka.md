###Pre-Ride:

One fine evening, with cups of tea in our hands we were talking about our last ride together. It'd been a one full year since we went together on a ride. Both of us were procrastinating it since then, for one or the other reason.

It was the same week last year when we first went out together:), so this was a good time to quench our thirst for a drive and re-live those memories.

The destination that came up my mind at once was coorg, as I was longing to go there ever since I earned my motorcycle :)

She said yes, and we got into the preparation. This time I had a some money with me [which i usually lack ;)], so i bought a helmet for this and coming trips. Another important thing to get were rain clothes [ever heard of coorg monsoons?]

So, all prepared, we started waiting for the friday.

###Day1:

Friday came, and we were all set for the ride. We didn't have any saddle bags, so packed the luggage in a trekking bag and tied it to the side. [my idea of tying belts came into use here :)]

This time, surprisingly, the plan was to 'not' hurry :). So, 7:30 was the time when we saddled on.

From nice road, we landed onto mysore road and in another half n hour we stopped to have breakfast. Had dosas and idlies and rice :). A heavy breakfast is always a good start for the day, right.

From here on, my buddy shifted to the driving seat till the turn to Coorg, at Srirangapatna. [My 'devilish' plan was to let her drive on mysore road, so that I can take on the curvy roads afterwards :)]

In 2hrs or so, and 110 kms, we were at Srirangapatna, where we missed the right turn for coorg [though there were huge hoardings telling the direction there] and had to take a u-turn. Not much a pain, it happens with me 9/10 times :)

On this turn, we stopped for a while, had nariyal pani, and chatted a bit, with each other and with the nariyal pani guy :).

The route from here was -> Hunsur -> Gonikopal -> Ponampet -> Kadamakoli

Road condition was good and the drive was pretty smooth till Gonikopal.

We entered the coorg region by 2PM, where we thanked god for our rain clothes as it had started down-pouring heavily by this time [that was pretty expected btw]. We sat for lunch at Gonikopal and had a chit-chat with the restaurant's owner. [My friend has this knack of befriending people very easily :) ]

Leaving that place by 3pm, we took this nice bumpy ride and reached kadamakoli by 5pm. Now, in front of our eyes were 500mts of mud-road [only mud actually].

Till this time i haven't been involved in off-roading on avenger, so i was a bit reluctant. But, here came a shooting dialog from my pillion, "Yahin bus ho gayi, to ladakh me kya karega..??".

And the next moment I was standing in front of the cottages, crossing that part of mud-road. 

We met the owners and their granny on reaching. And as I have already told about this very cool knack of my pillion, it didn't take much time for us to feel at home. The owners were very nice people. We had dinner and dozed off by 10pm. I was ON for a glass of wine, but i could clearly see that redness of anger in my pillion's eyes;), so just left the idea.

###Day2:

This was the day which I call the 'Complete Aish' Day.

Woke up at 9am, and got to hear that today's wishlist items are trekking, ziplining and river rafting.

No Riding?? w.t.hell..

But still, it ended up with a 50km run to-fro the river rafting base. :)

Anyhow, we had breakfast by 11am and were waiting for the other family who was to join us for trekking. In the meanwhile, lots of pics were clicked in the lush green plains in front of the cottages.

We got 4pm as our time for river rafting so had 3 more hours at our expense.

All of us got together by 12, and left for the upstream trekking. I had a really awesome experience there, because all this while I had the picture of trekking as 'a boring walk up the hill'. But this was different, we had to climb up the river, against the flow. Real fun.

Here I had my first experience with the leeches too. Always thought that leeches are those big black creatures hungry for your blood. But these were very slim and nice, and I didnt even get to know that they were sticking to my legs until someone told me so.

On our way back, to my luck, we came across a group of good and nice birds there;) and i got involved in bird gazing. Suddenly, realizing that I was left far behind my group I started moving again to catch up with them.

End of trekking and we were ready for the zip-lining. I had no idea what it was until I saw it. And the idea was cool actually, you have to slide on an iron cable all the way from one peak to another crossing the river..zipppiiingg..thats where the name came from, i guess :)

Had some more fun, clicked some more pics, had lunch and off we were on the motorcycle again going for river rafting. There we faced a bit of disappointment. Due to some miscommunication, they got 25 guys there, while one round could accommodate 24. So we both dropped the idea of rafting thinking to do it some other time.

We were back in our base by 6pm, and somehow I was feeling hungry again. The owners of the homestay were nice enough to feed us in their own dining hall. We sat there till 8pm and played some board games with them.

Had dinner then and went off to sleep by 10pm, hoping to start early the next day, as we hadn't done any sight seeing yet.

###Day3:

Huh, the plans of an early start usually go in vain. This time was no exception :).

I woke up to see the clock showing 8am on my face, and chhotu serving me tea and biscuits.

Hurrying up i took bath and was ready in the breakfast hall by 9am, just to see my dear already sitting there chatting with people and checking her mails. I felt a bit embarrassed, as it was me who asked for an early start.

Somehow we managed to get the luggage on the bike by 12, and left the good, nice resort. The plan was to go for kushalnagar now. As we didn't want to rush, so the idea of madikeri was dropped.

On our way, we passed irpu falls and dubare elephant camp. Found some families camping there, but we didn't stop due to time shortage.

Slowly and steadily driving, we reached the Tibet colony, kushalnagar, by 3pm.

<div class="image">

</div>

Had a nice view of the temple there. I was actually awed by the hugeness of the statues. It was a long time since I saw a tibetan temple. The last time was McLeodganj when I was like 12yrs old.

My partner, a girl she was, how can she live without shopping there. So we hopped into the market and searched the shops to see all the things they were selling, to come out buying a pair of good pajamas [for her of course].

5pm was the time when we left that place, and sat to have lunch, just 2 kms from that place. We actually spent some good time lunching and talking about the wine which we could have brought from coorg :).

Started our journey home at 6pm, and it wasn't much time when darkness took over, and it started raining. We had to slow down a bit, as it was a 2 lane road and oncoming traffic was causing too much glare in this rain. We stopped and had a sip of water at the junction where we had to take a left turn for srirangapatna and drive in pitch dark away from the highway lights for the next 20kms or so.

Oh, did I mention that it was my companion who drove till here, whispering something to herself all the way. Ah, she don't like to drive slow.

</div>

The next 20kms were awesomely dark :). No person and no vehicle along with us. The headlights were good enough to see through this dark, but still I wished I had a xenon setup there. All this way I was secretly praying not to encounter a ghost there. :)

Safe and sound, we reached Srirangapatna, and the next 120kms to home was the plain highway ride in rains. I actually drove a bit faster than my style here. We entered city at 11:30 and were at our places by 11:45.

With memories of lush green forests, the morning fogs and the sound of flowing water we entered home peacefully, let out a sigh of happiness..

...And lived happily ever after!!
